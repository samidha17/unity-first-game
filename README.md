# Improvements

- [] Add a background music track.
- [] Add a Pause Menu which will have the following options in it:
	* Resume Game
	* New Game
	* High Scores (you'll have to save the high scores somewhere in the persistent memory)
	* Quit
- [] Restrict the lives to a finite number. (You can also keep some '1 ups' to add to your lives)
- [] Smoothen up the grass.
- [] The ball doesn't look very blended with the background, do something about it.
- [] The ball seems like it's floating or hovering above the ground, make it touch the ground. Here is how it looks.

- [] The adversary that you've added seems to get stuck below the right side stair, I don't know why that is happening. Also see if you can make it move in a wavy manner. (sort of like a sine curve)
- [] Add animations:
	* Rotate the coins (a little sparkle would be honey upon the pancakes)
	* The bombs should look lit
	* Explosion animation and sound when the ball touches the ground
- [] The ball keeps moving in the direction of key press, make it decelerate; if you've already added the deceleration then make it decelerate more quickly.
- [] A buried enemy won't do any harm. Very considerate of you to take care of that the user will not have to worry about the enemy, but they LOVE adventure, beleive it.
