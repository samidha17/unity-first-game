# Improvements - 2

- [] Add highscore menu.
- [x] Adjust friction in such a way that the ball doesn't stick to the sides of the ground.
- [] Add animations for ball for it to change when it rolls, gets hurt, etc.
- [] End the first level.
- [] Make two more levels.
- [] Complete the mechanics of moving enemies.

 * Ideas for levels: adding slopes, spikes, etc. Create different layouts for different levels.
 * Bounce the ball once when the ball loses a life and then respawn it to the checkpoint.
 
 
# Improvements

- [x] Add a background music track.
- [x] Add a Pause Menu which will have the following options in it:
	* Resume Game
	* New Game
	* High Scores (you'll have to save the high scores somewhere in the persistent memory)
	* Quit
- [x] Restrict the lives to a finite number. (You can also keep some '1 ups' to add to your lives)
- [x] Smoothen up the grass.
- [x] The ball doesn't look very blended with the background, do something about it.
- [x] The ball seems like it's floating or hovering above the ground, make it touch the ground. Here is how it looks.

- [] The adversary that you've added seems to get stuck below the right side stair, I don't know why that is happening. Also see if you can make it move in a wavy manner. (sort of like a sine curve)
- [] Add animations:
	* [x] Rotate the coins (a little sparkle would be honey upon the pancakes)
	* [x] The bombs should look lit
	* [] Explosion animation and sound when the ball touches the ground
- [x] The ball keeps moving in the direction of key press, make it decelerate; if you've already added the deceleration then make it decelerate more quickly.
- [] A buried enemy won't do any harm. Very considerate of you to take care of it in a way that the user will not have to worry about the enemy, but they LOVE adventure, believe it.
